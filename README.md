# Human-or-Bot

Please find the required code to generate the human-or-bot dataset in [dataset generation](https://github.com/cberrioa/Human-or-Bot/tree/master/dataset%20generation).

Since there were many experiments in the paper ['An Empirical study on Pre-trained Embeddings and Language Models for Bot Detection'](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4317.pdf), only will be uploaded the code of those with the best results. Please feel free to ask for the other experiments.

## Note about dataset generation.
Dataset generation can be a little bit time consuming, if you want to get the datasets, please send us an email <agarcia@expertsystem.com>, <cberrio@expertsystem.com> or <jmgomez@expertsystem.com>.
